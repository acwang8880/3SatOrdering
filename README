RUNNING
-------
This version of the 3SAT solver features a refactored code base that
separates the arbitrary precision integer library into a stand-alone unit
with a stand-alone dynamically linked library (e.g., 'libjhjr_math.so' on
Linux systems).  Hence, in order for the 3SAT solver to run, this library
file must be placed in the dynamic link loader's library path (e.g.,
'/usr/local/lib/' on Linux).  Alternatively, it is possible to specify
the library's location with the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on
MacOS X) environment variable, e.g.:

	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=3sat-0.9.0/jhjr_math:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
